        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Chicken curry is a flavorful dish made by cooking chicken in a spiced gravy. To prepare it, marinate chicken pieces with yogurt, turmeric, chili powder, and salt, then set aside. Heat oil in a pan, saut√© onions until golden brown, and add ginger-garlic paste. Stir in spices like cumin, coriander, garam masala, and turmeric, followed by pureed tomatoes. Cook the mixture until the oil separates, then add the marinated chicken and cook thoroughly.</p>

        <p>Once the chicken is well-coated in the spice mixture, add water to create a gravy. Cover and simmer until the chicken is tender. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve hot with steamed rice or flatbreads like naan or roti. This simple yet delicious curry is a staple in many cuisines and can be adjusted to suit different spice preferences.</p>
